# Civ Alerts
#### Version 0.0.1 - Alpha
Created by Nolan Melander

## About

Civ Alerts is a discord bot currently in the early development stages. It is being created with the goal of being able 
to notify players who have not taken their turn after a specified amount of time, as set by the game host. The first 
release of Civ Alerts will require manual updates by the players, but the future goal is to integrate the bot to work 
directly with Civilization multiplayer games to automatically update without any need for user interaction.
